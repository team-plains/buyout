## Communication plan

We will communicate VIA Zoom/Remo and Slack. If we are buddy or pair programming we break out into rooms on Zoom. Whenever we bring up a topic for discussion we make sure that everyone has some kind of input and is listened to (majority vote). We collectively promise to make sure everyone’s voice is not only heard but their ideas and opinions genuinely considered. 

## Conflict plan

When there is a disagreement we put it to a majority vote. If a minority of members strongly disagrees with the majority or if we are at a stand still we bring each case to the instructor to resolve the issue. In order to create a safe environment we will adhere to Code Fellow’s code of conduct on and off campus.

### What do we do if someone is not pulling their weight? 

Daily sync-up to evaluate individual progress

Take a break. As a group. Have a group intervention. 

If it is area-expertise based, discuss doing a role-change! No biggy!

### What do we do if someone is taking over? 

If someone has a concern they can bring it to the attention of another group member. If they are in agreement it becomes a group discussion/intervention.

## Work plan: We will have a Github project where everyone is a collaborator. We will create a legend for each day on the github project that will have user story/feature issues.
